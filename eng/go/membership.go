// Membership-defined types — the convergence point for the two ways the
// kernel installs a "type whose inhabitants are the values satisfying a
// rule": the BORU path (predicateUnifier, rule = a BORU fn body run via
// RunPredicate) and the host-Go path (memberBehavior, rule = a Go func).
// Both answer the same question — "does v inhabit this type?" — at the
// same kernel touch-points (Match for dispatch, Unify for `is`/`case`/
// return checks, Format/canon, Compare). Only the evaluator differs, so
// the Match and Unify CORES live here and both Behaviors route through
// them; the per-path structs hold just the evaluator.

// baseBehavior returns the Behavior a membership Behavior delegates
// Format/Equal/Compare to: the Behavior it wrapped, or DefaultBehavior
// when it wrapped none.

// unifyMembership is the shared Unify contract. The membership question —

// concrete it is a value-vs-value question (e.g. `stdin is stdout`, two
// distinct members of the SAME type), and when NEITHER is it is purely
// type-level; both defer to the structural rule (value / lattice
// equality), NOT membership — admitting the first satisfying member would
// otherwise treat distinct members as equal.
//
// On the membership branch it admits the candidate the oracle accepts
// (yielding the oracle's possibly-narrowed output), and fails
// DEFINITIVELY when the candidate is rejected — not ErrNoUnifier — so the
// kernel's structural fallback cannot re-admit a non-member by lattice
// subtyping alone.

// match — the candidate itself for a Go predicate, or RunPredicate's
// result for a BORU one.
