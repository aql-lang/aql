# Refuse newly-added large or executable-binary blobs.
#
# Two compiled Go binaries (tools/piecetool/piecetool, test/go/piecetool/piecetool,
# 6.9MB each) were committed in the four-piece cut and deleted a commit later —
# but a delete does not reclaim anything: the blob stays in history forever and
# every clone keeps paying for it. test/solardemo/solardemo (8.6MB) sat tracked
# for far longer. .gitignore only helps once someone notices; this gate is what
# notices.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-no-binaries.sh              # check working tree vs merge-base with main
#   scripts/check-no-binaries.sh <base-ref>   # check vs an explicit base
#
# Allow a genuinely-needed large file by adding its exact path to ALLOW below.
