# Performance baseline — suite, gates, and 2026-07 snapshot

This note records the repo's performance-baseline system: what the
benchmark suites cover, how to run and compare them, the deterministic
regression *gates* that run in `make test`, and the measured snapshot
taken when the system landed (2026-07, together with the sub-engine
pool optimization described at the end).

## The suites

Run everything from the repo root:

```bash
make bench                 # all suites, 1s benchtime each
make bench BENCH_TIME=5s   # longer runs for lower variance
```

Compare before/after an engine change with benchstat:

```bash
git stash && make bench > before.txt && git stash pop
make bench > after.txt
benchstat before.txt after.txt
```

| Suite | Where | Pins |
|---|---|---|
| `BenchmarkKernel*` | `eng/go/perf_baseline_bench_test.go` | kernel primitives: CompareValues (scalar/list/map), Unify, CanonValue, OrderedMap |
| `BenchmarkTape*` | `eng/go/tape_test.go` | gap-buffer tape vs slice splicing on deep recursion |
| `BenchmarkParse` | `eng/go/parser/perf_baseline_bench_test.go` | parse cost per source shape (scalars, lists, maps, fns, parens, dotchains, interp strings, lambdas) |
| `BenchmarkBytecodeBaseline` | `lang/go/bytecode_baseline_bench_test.go` | end-to-end Run per dispatch shape (the Stage-0 corpus) |
| `BenchmarkStage6` | `lang/go/bytecode_stage6_bench_test.go` | interpreter vs compiled execution, parse/compile amortised out |
| `BenchmarkParens` | `lang/go/paren_bench_test.go` | per-paren representation cost |
| `BenchmarkPerfWords` | `lang/go/perf_baseline_bench_test.go` | collection words (sort/filter/each/fold over 500 elems), map build/get, string words |
| `BenchmarkPerfCheck` / `BenchmarkPerfCompile` | same file | static-check cost and emit cost per dispatch shape |

## The gates (run in `make test`, no benchmarks needed)

Execution time is GC-noisy; allocations per op are deterministic, so
the hard regression signals are allocation ceilings:

- `TestCompiledAllocCeilings` (`lang/go/bytecode_allocguard_test.go`) —
  compiled-mode allocs/op per shape.
- `TestInterpAllocCeilings` (`lang/go/interp_allocguard_test.go`) —
  interpreter-mode allocs/op AND **bytes/op** per shape. The byte
  ceiling catches the class alloc counts miss: ONE big allocation per
  op (the pre-pool interpreter allocated a fresh ~1024-entry tape
  per body invocation — a single alloc, ~164KB).

Lower a ceiling when an optimization reduces allocations; never raise
one without a documented reason.

## The sub-engine pool (what moved the numbers)

Before 2026-07, every `InvokeBody` / `autoEvalList` / paren-value /
interp-hole evaluation built a fresh sub-engine whose tape starts at
`DefaultTapeInitialFloor` (1024 entries ≈ 164KB), so each element of a
higher-order word paid ~164KB and retained results pinned whole tape
buffers. `Registry.enginePool` (registry.go) now pools idle reusable
sub-engines with `reuseTape` — the same in-place `Tape.Reload` the VM's
island engine proved sound — and `runPooledSub` (invoke.go) copies
results out of the tape alias. Reentrancy is safe by construction
(nested sub-runs pop different engines); `ForkConcurrent` resets the
pool because pooled engines pin their creating registry.

Measured effect: `each [add 1]` over 800 elements dropped from 64.6ms
/ 155.8MB per run to 16.2ms / 5.0MB (4× time, 31× bytes); `fold` from
59.7ms / 153.9MB to 11.1ms / 3.1MB. Compiled `do_body` fell from
≈4,800 to ≈411 allocs/op and the branch shapes from ≈1,900 to ≈1,012.
The alloc-guard ceilings were lowered to pin the new levels.
