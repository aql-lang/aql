// HTTPOps is the host capability that supplies the outbound HTTP
// transport used by aql:net's `fetch`. It exists so the transport —
// and therefore TLS configuration, the connection pool, and protocol
// negotiation — is chosen by the host rather than hard-wired into the
// word handler.
//
// It returns a RoundTripper rather than an *http.Client deliberately.
// The pool and the TLS configuration live on the transport, while the
// per-request timeout lives on the client, so `fetch` builds a cheap
// client around a shared transport for each call. Handing back a client
// instead would force the implementation to key its cache on the
// guest-supplied timeout, which is an unbounded cache keyed by
// untrusted input.
//
// TLSProfile is the resolved TLS configuration for the request; id is
// the resolved client identity (nil when the profile names none).
// Implementations build and return a transport — CACHING IS THE
// CALLER'S JOB (native.ResolveTransport), because a profile names an
// identity by a registry-scoped name, so a process-wide cache keyed on
// the profile alone would serve registry A's transport to registry B's
// identically-named identity.

// which way the Insecure field points — per the no-zero-value-overload
// rule (eng/go/CLAUDE.md), the SAFE state is the zero value, so a
// profile nobody configured cannot silently skip verification.
//
// Every field is comparable so the whole struct can be a map key.
