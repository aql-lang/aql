# CPU-profile share of the collection loops — the instrument Stage 2's gate
# was re-specified onto (design/FULL-COMPILATION.0.md §11, falsifier F1b).
#
# Why share and not wall clock: F1b was TESTED on this class of host and the
# measurement established that wall clock cannot resolve it — two runs of
# byte-identical code differed by 5.4% geomean. Profile SHARE is comparative
# within a single run, so the machine's noise divides out of it. This records
# the share; like everything else in the register it never gates.
#
# It profiles the DISPATCH-DENSE interpreter benchmarks (BenchmarkParens and
# BenchmarkBytecodeBaseline, both of which drive `RunInterp`), not the
# collection-WORD suite: in BenchmarkPerfWords the 500-element inner work
# swamps dispatch and the collection loops sit near 3-5% of samples, where a
# regression would hide inside the run-to-run spread. In the dispatch-dense
# set the same loops are ~15% and ~9% of samples — about four times the
# resolution for the same machine noise.
#
# Two bases are recorded per anchor, because they answer different questions:
#
#   cum_pct_total  — share of ALL samples. Moves when anything outside the
#                    interpreter moves too (GC, parse), so it is the honest
#                    absolute but a noisy comparator.
#   cum_pct_interp — share of Engine.Run's cumulative time. Divides out any
#                    uniform shift in how much of the process is interpreter
#                    at all, which is what makes it the comparator F1b wants:
#                    "did the collection loops get more expensive RELATIVE TO
#                    the interpreter they live in".
#
# Anchors are the three functions present on BOTH sides of a Stage-2-style
# comparison — the seam functions themselves (collectForward,
# collectCandidateScan, collectArrival) exist only after the extraction, so
# they cannot be compared to anything. They are called BY these anchors, so
# whatever they cost shows up here. Cum% does not sum across a call chain;
# read each anchor on its own.
