// fnReturnPark decides whether a collapsing paren left a single unquoted
// Function value, in which case stepCloseParen's rewind steps PAST the value
// instead of re-stepping it into a call — parens place values, they never
// re-step them, reference and inline literal alike; only a reach-lowered
// group is excluded, because its re-step IS the dispatch (NUR073's BROAD
// verdict, clause 3; design/FN-VALUE-OPEN-WORK.0.md §2).
//
// The end-to-end behaviour is pinned above this module — `lang/spec/ref.tsv`
// §8 and `lang/go/fn_return_park_test.go`, on both engines. This test exists
// for the arm ITSELF: core/go is gated by its OWN suite at a 100% floor
// (`make cover-gate-core`, core/go/CLAUDE.md), so a decision function reached
// only from above reads as uncovered there however well the merged profile
// scores it. Same failure mode, and same remedy, as commit cdc7a11's
// canon_stage5_test.go.
//
// Each row also carries a reason, because every `return 0` here is a
// deliberate negative: the whole risk of this change is a park that fires one
// case too wide and swallows a value the main loop still owes work on.
