// GUARD NARROWING (ADR-013, 2026-08-08 amendment): the flow-sensitive
// half of branch analysis. `if (x is T) [then] [else]` tells the
// analysis something different about x in each arm, and this file is
// what says it — extracting the `x is T` facts a condition carries
// (extractGuardClauses), installing the then-arm refinement
// (ApplyGuardNarrowing) and the else-arm complement
// (ApplyComplementNarrowing), each returning the restore closure its
// caller defers.
//
// Two invariants are load-bearing and must not drift:
//
//   - The narrowed binding KEEPS the source's value ID. is-narrowing is
//     static-only — at run time the binding is unchanged — so a fresh ID
//     would strand every later reference as an unseated carrier.
//   - Else-narrowing applies only to a SINGLE-clause condition. For a
//     conjunction the else path is `notA or notB`; neither clause can be
//     subtracted, and one exhaustive clause does not make the else
//     unreachable.
//
// Core, not check: every operand is a core Value / *Type, the bindings
// live in r.Defs, and the diagnostics go to r.Check — all core-owned.
// The predicate-implied-type derivation these clauses consult is
// guard_predicate.go, moved down alongside.

// GuardClause describes one `x is T` clause detected in a condition.
