// Region extent — the syntactic span a compiled region descriptor covers
// (design/FULL-COMPILATION.0.md §6.2, Stage 4).
//
// A statement's extent is NOT statically bounded: its own operands can move
// it, because a paren group at position 0 that `def`s a FUNCTION word
// creates a forward-collection barrier at position 1 that did not exist when
// the scan began. Which slots a statement owns is an OUTPUT of running it.
// So the descriptor's unit is a REGION — everything to the next HARD
// delimiter — whose boundaries are syntactic and cannot shift under any
// binding, and collection returns a cursor saying where it actually stopped.
//
// The hard delimiters are `end`, a close paren, and the window's end. An
// OPEN paren is not one: it opens a nested scope the region contains.
//
// Why this walk is sound as a bound, which is not obvious. Two pieces of
// error-selection state are read by scanning BACKWARD from the pointer, and
// neither scan stops at `end`:
//
//   - strandedForwardError picks the Forward it blames (engine.go:6543),
//   - stepEnd picks the Forward it drains (engine.go:6604).
//
// A Forward parked in an EARLIER region would therefore be visible from
// inside this one, and a region-bounded descriptor could not carry it. It
// cannot happen, because at most ONE Forward is ever live per paren scope:
// insertForward is the sole parking site; its bare-word caller is guarded by
// the strict barrier (commit-or-strand runs before dispatch, and neither
// outcome reaches a second park); and its execFnDefLiteral caller — a
// function VALUE forward-collecting, which the barrier does NOT guard — is
// held shut by the arrival loop routing that value into the parked slot
// instead. `end` then drains the one that exists. Pinned in
// region_extent_test.go; the two raise texts it separates are pinned as
// lang/spec/forward-barrier.tsv §9.
//
// The same invariant bounds the diagnostic state F2 widened this list with:
// IsFnShapeTypedBindingContext, pendingForwardFunc and polyReachBound all
// key on the enclosing collector's Forward, so the collector they find is
// always the region's own.

// RegionEnd returns the exclusive index at which the region starting at
// `from` ends: the first hard delimiter at or after it, or the window's
// length. Nested paren scopes are CONTAINED, not terminated — an open paren
// carries the walk to its matching close, so a region spans a whole group
// rather than stopping inside one.
//
// Out-of-range and negative starts clamp; the result is always in
// [max(from,0), w.Len()].
